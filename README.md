# Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA) to simulate low dose CT scans: Application to Lung Nodule Detection
This repository contains the code for **Physics-Informed Data Augmentation to simulate low dose CT scans: Application to Lung Nodule Detection**.
Our proposed **Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA)** method leverages the milliampere-seconds (mAs) and Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) profiles of various CT reconstruction
kernels to simulate the effects of various dose exposures. In this approach, the NPS of a higher dose CT scan is used to generate correlated noise, which is then stochastically inserted into the training data to simulate the noise characteristics of the lower dose exposure. We applied PIDA in training a neural network designed to reduce false positives in a lung nodule detection algorithm. We evaluated the impact of the noise insertion training method by assessing
lung nodule detection performance on low-dose CT scans.

PIDA is a method developed to simulate realistic low-dose CT noise based on imaging physics principles. Unlike conventional augmentation strategies that add uncorrelated Gaussian noise, PIDA injects spatially correlated noise into CT images to closely mimic the noise texture seen in clinical low-dose acquisitions. PIDA utilizes NPS profiles extracted from CT DICOM metadata to model noise. Assuming radial symmetry, the two-dimensional NPS is calculated as:

</p>

where ùë¢ and ùë£ are the spatial frequency coordinates. To simulate noise in the spatial domain, PIDA generates a noise field by randomizing phase information and applying an inverse Fourier transform:
<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/fourier.png" alt="Example Image" width="400"/>
</p>
where sqrt of NPS(u,v) is the amplitude derived from the measured NPS,
œÜ(u, v) are random phase shifts uniformly sampled from [0, 2œÄ],
F‚Åª¬π denotes the inverse Fourier transform. This approach ensures that the noise introduced into each training sample retains the same frequency characteristics (texture and granularity) as clinically acquired low-dose CT images.

During training, PIDA stochastically injects this correlated noise into images with varying magnitudes (noise standard deviation in the range [1, 5]) to emulate the noise conditions found in scans with different dose exposures (e.g., 20‚Äì80 mAs). By augmenting the training set in this physics-informed manner, PIDA improves generalizability and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across CT datasets acquired with different radiation dose levels.
