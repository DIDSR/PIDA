## Physics-Informed Data Augmentation to simulate low dose CT scans: Application to Lung Nodule Detection
Our proposed Physics-Informed Data Augmentation (PIDA) method lever-
ages the mAs and Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) profiles of various CT reconstruction
kernels to simulate the effects of various dose exposures. In this approach, the NPS
of a higher dose CT scan is used to generate correlated noise, which is then stochas-
tically inserted into the training data. This simulates the noise characteristics of the
lower dose exposure and enhances variability within the training set. To demonstrate
PIDAâ€™s applicability in improving the generalizability of CNNs, we applied PIDA in
training a neural network designed to reduce false positives in a lung nodule detection
algorithm. We evaluated the impact of the noise insertion training method by assessing
lung nodule detection performance on low-dose CT scans.
